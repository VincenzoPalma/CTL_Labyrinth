# Labyrinth Hunt

Labyrinth Hunt is an asymmetric hunter vs. runner game developed in Unreal Engine 5. The game leverages the FindMe system to implement intelligent AI behaviors for NPCs.
## Main Features
- Dynamic Labyrinth Maps: Maze layouts with exits randomly selected in each game.
- Asymmetric Gameplay: Two AI-controlled runner NPCs vs. one human-controlled hunter.
- Objective: The hunter must track and eliminate both runners with his weapon before they escape.

## FindMe
This game uses FindMe, a tool for game engines that enables the use of CTL (Computation Tree Logic) model checking to develop advanced AI behavior for NPCs. The system is developed in Unreal Engine 5, with its core implemented in C++ and functionality integrated through Blueprints for ease of use.
